My immediate TODOS:

- Placeholder isn't highlighted properly when adding a tag
- \(..\) display bug on autotags
- Add new tags to the front of the list
- Sort tags by usage
- Delete tags!
- Filter images by tag
- Global rename tag
- Zoom / color picker
- Spell check? (Or at least some kind of autocomplete.)
- 404 when editing an image (only occasionally)
