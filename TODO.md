My immediate TODOS:

- Be able to toggle "show in list" on existing keywords
- Hover over new keywords in auto-tags and add them to a category
- Delete tags!

After that:

- Sort tags by usage
- Project setup: Don't suggest a placeholder tag if all examples are already in the layout
- Filter images by tag
- Global Find > Replace tag
- Spell check? (Or at least some kind of autocomplete.)

Maybe later:

- Highlight tags that often go together?
