My immediate TODOS:

- Be able to toggle "show in list" on existing keywords
- Add new tags to the front of the list
- Delete tags!
- Scroll down to category again after adding a tag

After that:

- Highlight tags that often go together?
- Sort tags by usage
- Project setup: Don't suggest a placeholder tag if all examples are already in the layout
- Filter images by tag
- Global Find > Replace tag
- Image Zoom
- Color picker -> Name
- Spell check? (Or at least some kind of autocomplete.)

... and then more things!
